## Abstract
This paper investigates the possibility of manipulation on social media platforms, focusing on Twitter and its owner, Elon Musk. With the growing influence of social media on public opinion, it is crucial to ensure the impartiality and accuracy of information shared on these platforms. This study designs and implements a tweet monitoring and sentiment analysis system, called 'Doubtfire', to detect potential manipulation by analysing trends in deleted tweets in real-time. The monitor focuses on tweets containing keywords related to Elon Musk and his inventions, such as Tesla and SpaceX, to gather a comprehensive data sample. The results of the study provide valuable insights into the extent of Elon Musk's potential influence on Twitter and shed light on the importance of impartiality and integrity in social media information sharing.
